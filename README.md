# BadBot3
Got my BadBot Chatbot up and running, and my training datasets created, now just needs tweaks; placed in new project. 
This was a Chatbot project for my class at The University of Advancing Technology.  The programming language is Python, and it 
utilizes the chatterbot API for Machine Learning purposes.  The program was created within the Pycharm IDE.
