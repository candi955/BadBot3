Unfortunately, the product you just bought is out of stock and under our inspection. We recently got many complaints about this product, our costumers sent us photos that show the product was delivered in bad condition. We are trying to solve this problem with our carrier A.S.A.P, but at the moment we are out of stock. Due to a technical problem, we didn't update this listing with the quantity of the product. We are very sorry about that and we hope you will agree to accept the cancellation. 
Why haven�t I received my order
We regret to inform you that the item you ordered is actually out of stock and is on back order. We are expecting to receive these back in stock in approximately 2-3 weeks per the manufacturer. This is still not guaranteed as it depends on the manufacturer, sometimes it's sooner, sometimes it could be later as well. This is just an estimated time. That being said, we are very sorry we are unable to ship this out to you and apologize for any inconvenience this has caused you. We have 2 solutions for you. A) We can offer you a full refund and call it even, we will still leave you positive feedback and hope you do the same for us! An email cancellation will be sent by eBay, please accept it. B) If you don�t mind the wait, we can ship it out when it does come back in stock. To show you our gratitude and to send you a token of appreciation, we can offer you a 5% refund on the order if you choose this option. Please let us know which one works for you, sorry once again. We appreciate your understanding and patience
Why haven�t I received my order
It is an extreme emotion of shame and regrets that we have to inform you we are unable to complete this transaction and we will be issuing you a full refund right away. I am so so so sorry about that. We actually ran out of stock on this item a few weeks ago and with a few clicks (a mistake) on eBay, this item was accidentally relisted when it was not supposed to. I am so sorry about that. As a good gesture, we would like to extend a 10% discount on any other order or future item you place with us. I appreciate your understanding regarding this issue and once again I apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused you
Can you ship me my item to a PO Box?
I apologize but as stated in our list the item cannot be shipped to a P.O., box please provide a physical address to ship this item so we will be able to start processing your order.
Can you cancel the order?
We respect your request to cancel the order, however, we are unable to guarantee that the order can be canceled at this point. When an order is placed, it gets routed to our vendor within 2 hours. The best time to cancel the order is before those 2 hours. Once the order is routed, we have to �catch� the order with our vendor before it ships as most of our customers appreciates the fast shipping. The best thing to do at this point is simply refuse the delivery once it arrives that way the order will go right back to our warehouse. We can issue you a full refund once it gets routed. Thank you and have a great day.
Can you cancel the order?
Thank you. Your order has been canceled. If payment was made it will be refunded within 24-48 hours or even less depending on the method of payment.

I need to know about international shipping
Currently, we ship our items internationally (Outside the USA) through Ebays Global Shipping program, where we actually ship the items to eBay�s shopping center, and then eBay will re-ship it to the end customer. Due to this process, we have no control in postage/fees/import duty/taxes. Ebay is the one that calculates and handles that. If you are able to Buy It Now and check out, the postage should automatically calculate for you. If you are unable to check out, it simply means the item is not available to ship through this program due to weight/size/category restrictions. We thank you for your business and hope that you place the order if you can, and we will do our part and get it out to you right away. Typical turnaround time is 10-14 business days. Thank you!
I want to complain about cost of the item
In order to provide our customers with a larger variety of products within the fastest amount of time, we often ship our items directly from our vendor which is included. Normally the price is not displayed so we apologize for the confusion, please disregard the price, it is a wholesale price quote.  If you insist, I am willing to partially refund you for the price differences as a service, but know that I am taking it out of my own pocket.
When the item will be shipped?
Orders typically ship within 1-3 business days of payment. (Weekends do not count as business days and we are closed during weekends) We do our best to ship out as quickly as possible. This is reflected in the estimated delivery date you were originally given. We will update you with tracking information as soon as it ships. Thank you and have a nice day
I need a tracking number on my shipment.
We ship from multiple warehouses and vendors and there is often a delay in obtaining the tracking # with certain ones. This should have shipped out by now so please allow me 24-48 hours to contact them to obtain the tracking #. I should notify you soon when we get this information
